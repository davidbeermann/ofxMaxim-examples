# Usage examples for ofxMaxim addon

Collection of my audio synthesis experiments with the [ofxMaxim](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian/tree/master/openFrameworks/ofxMaxim) addon for [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/).

## Maximilian

ofxMaxim is a wrapper for the [Maximilian](http://maximilian.strangeloop.co.uk/) audio synthesis library for openFrameworks. The library is open source and is published under the MIT licence on [GitHub](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian). It was written by [Mick Grierson](http://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/staff/m-grierson/), faculty member of the [Department of Computing](http://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/) at [Goldsmiths College](http://www.gold.ac.uk/).

Apart from the C++ implementation the library was ported to JavaScript and released under [Maxim](https://github.com/micknoise/Maxim).

A little history and demo of the library can be found here: [Maximilian: C++ Audio and Music DSP Library, Mick Grierson, JUCE Summit 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Av78mtFF4).
